## Second blog post-reflecting on project

Hi guys just finished my first project for ST558. Lets talk about it some more

The overall goal of the first project in ST558 was to write functions that will manipulate and process  different data sets by creating a generic function to automatically plot the returned data. The document was written via R Markdown with outputs to.html. HERE is a link to the project.

I basically learned to write and execute functions in a new programming language of called R. The project was very time consuming and I'm sure I got a few extra gray hairs in my head while completing. Even though I started early and worked very hard on the project it took very long to complete. 

Being stuck so many times during the project I became good friends with Stackoverflow and Google. What I learnt the most is that they are great friends to have when stuck. 

If I had to start all over with the project I would not underestimate some parts of the project. Thats definately what I would do differently. You think you know how to do something and guess what???? - the code just refuse to run - a whole bunch of errors.
