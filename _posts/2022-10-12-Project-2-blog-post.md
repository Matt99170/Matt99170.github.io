## Project 2 Blog Post - ST558

In this project we created a vignette about contacting an API using functions to to query, parse, and return well-structured data. Additionally, we use the functions to obtain data from the API and do some exploratory data analysis. The API we used was Beer API. [Click here](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) to view the API link. One thing that I found interesting was 38% of Wisconsin breweries are either a brewpub or a bar and ironically the state of Wisconsin has the highest alcohol consumption according to [here](https://www.thecentersquare.com/wisconsin/this-is-where-wisconsin-ranks-among-the-drunkest-states-in-america/article_3ccd11a4-c261-563b-919a-e02a0254b6dd.html).

The first time I read the project I was a bit confused. I constantly re-read the project and slowly it started to make sense. 

The project was done with my project partner Rachel through a github repo connected to Rstudio. We both spent hours upon hours writing code and fixing errors including basic grammar that is usually taken for granted sometimes.

Concerning logic and programming, the most difficult part of the project was definately understanding API's, how it works and wrapping my head around terminology such as endpoints. I would say the writing functions part of the project made my head hurt. 

What I would do differently is getting started a little earlier. I was doing exam revision for the midterm test and decided to begin the project after the exam.
