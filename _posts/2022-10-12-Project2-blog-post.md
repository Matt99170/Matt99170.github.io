## Project 2 Blog Post -- ST558
Answer the following
• explain what you did in the project and any interesting findings
• reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:
– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?
• provide a link to the rendered github pages repo and the regular repo (non-github pages
site) as well!
The URL to this (rendered) blog post is what each individual will submit at the project assignment link.

The first time I read the project I was a bit confused. Re-reading and re-reading slowly, little by little it started to make sense. To give you a sense of how bad things were, the word "vignette" sounded like some kind of fancy diamond or precious metal--lol. 

The project was done with my project partner Rachel through a github repo connected to Rstudio. We both spent hours upon hours writing code and fixing errors including basic grammar that is usually taken for granted sometimes.

The most difficult part of the project was definately understanding API's, how it works and wrapping my head around terminology such as endpoints. I would say the writing functions part of the project made my head hurt. Luckly, Rachel helped alot with that. Logically the project wasn't to bad. Re-reading the project guidlines over and over helped. One thing I distinctly rememberd was unintentionally experimenting with mathematically functions such as mean on characters thinking it was numeric and I laughed so hard after I realized how silly it was.

What I would do differently is getting started a little earlier. I was doing exam revision for the midterm test and decided to begin the project after the exam. [HERE] is the link to the rendered github pages repo and [here] is the link for the regular repo.
