# Regression Models

Variable selection is intended to select the “best” variables to use as predictors. We what to select the best since our aim is to explain the data in the simpliest and easiest way to reduce time and computational cost.

Some popular variable selection algorithms are as follows,

## Backward elimination (BE)
This is the simplest of all variable selection procedures and can be easily implemented without special
software. 
* It usually involves examining all the predictors in the model
* Removing the predictor that is the most insignificant
* Reestimating the model
* Stop if no more predictors are insignificant.
