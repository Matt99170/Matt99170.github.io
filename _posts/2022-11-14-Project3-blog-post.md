## Project 3 Blog Post - ST558

Our goal with this project is to create predictive models and automating Markdown reports. 
We are using this [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by [Mashable](http://www.mashable.com) in a period of two years. 

Here are the two links to username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo itself

* what would you do differently?

Similar to project 2,  I would have definately get started a little earlier. I was doing exam revision for the midterm test and decided to begin the project after the exam. 

* what was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part was definately the automation. At first I though only a computer science genius could figure that out but in the end I managed.

* what are your big take-aways from this project?

My biggest take aways are to get started earlier, and even though at first the project may seem confusing at first, constantly re-reading the project will definately simplify what you need to do.
