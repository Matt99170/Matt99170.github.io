## Project 3 Blog Post - ST558

Our goal with this project was to create predictive models and automating Markdown reports for six different data_channel_is_* (Lifestyle, Entertainment, Business, Social Media, Tech and world) articles. 

We are using this [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by [Mashable](http://www.mashable.com) in a period of two years. 

The project was done with my project partner Magaritte. We both spent hours writing code and cleaning up the project. 

We used four predictive models: Two were linear regression models, a random forest model and a boosting model. Based on the predictors we chose the boosting model outperformed the others with the random forest model taking last spot.

## what I would do differently

Similar to project 2,  I would have definately get started a little earlier. I was doing exam revision for the midterm test and decided to begin the project after the exam. 

## Most difficult part

The most difficult part was definately the automation to have all six different data_channel_is_* rendered and updated for the relevant data.

## Big take-aways from this project

Even though automation is supposed to "make life easier" during this project I questioned on many occasions whether or not writing code to automate is actually easier or more difficult than just doing the analysis six times. Definately, next time it should be easier since I have some experience now.
