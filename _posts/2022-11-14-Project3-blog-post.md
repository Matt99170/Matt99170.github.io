## Project 3 Blog Post - ST558

Our goal with this project was to create predictive models and automating Markdown reports. 
We are using this [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by [Mashable](http://www.mashable.com) in a period of two years. 

Here are the two links to username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo itself

* what would you do differently?

Similar to project 2,  I would have definately get started a little earlier. I was doing exam revision for the midterm test and decided to begin the project after the exam. 

* what was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part was definately the automation to have all different data_channel_is_* render and updated for the relevant data.

* what are your big take-aways from this project?

My biggest take aways are to get started earlier, and even though the main purpose of automation in this project is to generate the six different data_channel_is_* markdown reports automatically, I definately felt that the writing code to automate and testing it felt more difficult than just doing the analysis six times.
