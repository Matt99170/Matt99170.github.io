## Project 3 Blog Post - ST558

Our goal with this project was to create predictive models and automating Markdown reports. 
We are using this [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by [Mashable](http://www.mashable.com) in a period of two years.

## what I would do differently

Similar to project 2,  I would have definately get started a little earlier. I was doing exam revision for the midterm test and decided to begin the project after the exam. 

## What was the most difficult part for

The most difficult part was definately the automation to have all six different data_channel_is_* rendered and updated for the relevant data.

## What are your big take-aways from this project

Even though automation is supposed to "make life easier" during this project I questioned on many occasions whether or not writing code to automate is actually easier or more difficult than just doing the analysis six times. Definately next time it should be easier since I have some experience now.
