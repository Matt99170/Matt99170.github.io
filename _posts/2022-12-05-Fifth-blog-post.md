Wow can you believe it. Almost the end of the course ST558.

### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

Definately I will try to incoperate programming into my routine and computers more. The most interesting thing that I will be looking to do some time in the near future is definately building apps using R shiny. 

### Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career?

R is one of the most widely used languages in the field of data science and statistics. Thats why this course is definately an asset for the future.

My ultimate goal is to achieve a PhD in Statistics which requires successfully completing this masters degree first. At some point at that level, statistics and data science will eventually overlap and I may very well be doing research in both statistics and data science.

### What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about? 

I am definately interested in learning python as another programming language.
