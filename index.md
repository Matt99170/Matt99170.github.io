Hello to everyone on the internet world. Thanks for stopping by my blog post. If you want to hear more on about data scientists, statisticians and machine learning engineers then you are in the right place.

A data scientist is a new kind of data expert who possesses different technical skill sets to analyse data. Data scientists use data to provide valuable insights that explains certain phenomena. Whether it be solving business problems, making improved decisions or forecasting future events, a data scientist is your "go to" person.

A data scientist needs to have knowledge of different programming languages as well as the ability to specify which machine learning approach is best to model the data presented. A machine learning engineer on the other hand, feeds the data into the model which were previously specified by the data scientists.

A more intriguing question is, how do a data scientist stack up against a statistician?

A statistician is one with a sound knowledge of statistics. A statistician is touted to use small collected data sets and follow concepts such as point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, p-values and so forth. However, a data scientists prides itself on very large data sets and is perceived to use "more friendly" approaches such as data ingest, data transormation and data story telling.

Reguardless of whether one is a data scientist or a statistician, they both depend on eachother's knowledge. Additionally, they both share a common goal which is to extract knowledge from data. Eventually as time passes and statisticians learn more about data scientists and vice-versa the two will eventually appreciate eachother even more and the fields may eventually merge as one. 

Both Statistics and Data Science are facinating in its own right. However, based on my current knowledge and background I see myself leaning more towards the side of being a statistician. As time passes and I begin to learn more my perspective may change.

Thank you for reading - Matthew.

# About me

I am from Trinidad and Tobago which is a small twin island republic located in the Caribbean. [HERE](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Td-map.png/260px-Td-map.png) is a picture of Trinidad and Tobago.

I am mostly busy so don't really have time for hobbies but I do love animals. 

My dog Fred is a German Shepherd and he have very big teeth - for smiling of course.
